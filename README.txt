Please ensure the files are in the same folder!!

1. Extract zip file
2. Open excel file -> File -> Info -> Protect Workbook -> Encrypt with Password -> Confirm password -> Back -> Save (impt!) -> Close file
3. Open python file -> Input 1235(HR personnel id no.) -> Input password to excel file -> test program
4. If you use a non-HR emp id, but pw is correct, the excel file will not open and will change password to "hackerman" (no quotes)

5. If you accidentally access the excel file when there is no pw, the pw is now the one you entered lol. You can change it again.
